Overview
========
Retailers can also use `rangespan.com/range <http://www.rangespan.com/range>`_ to make product selections

This page details how retailers can use the 'shortlist' tool to build and launch selected products.

The next section covers `Product Data. <Product%20Data.html>`_

Building shortlists
===================
Making a selection is often an iterative process, involving more than one person. Rangespan allows retailers to set aside named lists of products, called shortlists for further review.

The most common use of a shortlist is to combine the output of several search results. There are a number of different use cases:

- **Combine Multiple Search Results**: A buyer can create a shortlist for phone cases, and add products one by one or in batches, based on a number of different searches.
- **Save and share your work**: Buyers can choose products they find interesting and save these for further review. This allows different users to look at products at different times. 
- **Wishlists**: A buyer can single out products that are particularly interesting but have an uncompetitive cost price. Flagging these to Rangespan or to suppliers directly is an efficient way to push suppliers to provide better cost prices.

Download product data
=====================
Rangespan allows retailers to access selections in csv form. To do so, retailers can click the 'download' button to get access to their **current selection**. Save your work often! We recommended to first create a shortlist, then to download the content of that shortlist.


Launch product selections
=========================
Rangespan makes it easy to launch any number of products - just make a selection and click the launch button. For more detail on what happens after you've launched a product, see `this section <rangespan.com>`_.
