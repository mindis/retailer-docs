Rangespan Glossary
******************

ASIN
====
Amazon Standard Identification Number. Rangespan associates ASINs with a RIN for competitive insight (for example, competitive pricing). Rangespan will only monitor one ASIN per RIN, and our best guess at this ASIN is available to retailers for any RIN in their selection. For more detail see the relevant `wikipedia page on ASINs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number>`_. 

Category
========
Items are classified into a category taxonomy derived from Google's Shopping Search taxonomy. Items are automatically assigned based on attribute input from suppliers and crawled websites. Because of the large number of items and variety of source data categorisation will not be 100% accurate. You can notify Rangespan of errors at analysts@rangespan.com. Items selected for launch will be manually checked for accurate category assignment.

Description
===========
Rangespan provides a standard description of a product. This can be text or a list of features.


GTIN
====
Global Trade Item Number. We will represent all barcodes/UPCs/EANs as the 14 digit GTIN. For more detail on these terms see the relevant `wikipedia page on GTINs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number>`_. Rangespan uses this in combination with Manufacturer and MPN to uniquely identify a RIN.

Image URL
=========
Rangespan hosts the best available image for a RIN on our servers. This is provided to retailers for a 1-time download, and is not meant to be hotlinked to. We provide you with an 'image date' that can help you replace images with higher definition or larger images once these become available to Rangespan.

Item Name
=========
Each RIN has a short and descriptive item name. This is usually directly provided by the supplier, and cleaned up by Rangespan. 

Manufacturer
============
RINs are assigned to a manufacturer or brand; whichever is most easily recognised.

Manufacturer Part Number
========================
MPN or Manufacturer Part Code. Provided by the manufacturer to uniquely identify a product or series. Rangespan uses this in conjunction with GTIN and Manufacturer to uniquely describe a RIN.

RIN
===
Rangespan Identification Number. Analogous to the ASIN, a RIN is a rangespan specific identifier for a buyable product. There is no notion of parent / child RINs, any variation is described as it's own RIN.


Retailer Listing State
======================
Referred to as just state when there is no ambiguity. Once a retailer selects a RIN, Rangespan can take several steps to process these.

 - 'new' listings are vurrently being set up
 - 'live' listings are buyable
 - 'suspended' listings are RINs temporarily removed from sale
 - 'terminated' listings are no longer selling and removed from feed exchanges
