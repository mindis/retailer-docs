Rangespan Consolidated Offers
=============================

Rangespan aggregates offers from our suppliers to provide retailers with the latest price and inventory data. For SME Retailers, costs are set daily, and availability is refreshed several times a day. Enterprise retailers can set up the cost change process to be daily or weekly.

Each retailer listing has a 'state' to make it easy to understand the overall availability status for a retailer. A listing is 'New' while it is being set up, 'Live' once it is buyable, 'Suspended' if it is temporarily removed from sale, and 'Terminated' once a retailer has informed Rangespan they are no longer selling that product.

Prices are generated at midday British time, with cost prices that will apply for 24 hours, starting from Midnight:
