.. note:: If you cannot locate your specific query below, or you need to email us, you can get in touch at supplier-support@rangespan.com.


1. GENERAL
==========

I already have a relationship with a retailer on the Rangespan network, how does that affect my existing relationship?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
It doesn't. Rangespan's relationship with both suppliers and retailers is non-exclusive and you are free to trade directly if you wish. However, we believe that Rangespan is a great way to greatly expand your range without spending money an    d resources on buying in new stock, managing suppliers and processing orders.

Do I have to pay to list my product on the Rangespan network?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
No, there is no up-front registration fee or charge to list your products on Rangespan and to make them available to retailers.

Who pays for your service, the supplier or the retailer?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The retailer pays for the service, it is completely free for a supplier to work with us.

We can't drop-ship direct to individual end-customers from our warehouse, can I still be part of Rangespan's network?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Yes, we offer fulfillment services and can refer capable 3rd party fulfillment operations, so please get in touch to discuss. 

Who will the customer contact in case of any service issues?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For any service issue, the customer contacts the retailer via their usual customer service route. Rangespan makes various tools available to the retailer's customer service agents and will work with the supplier directly to resolve any exceptional issues.

What is a RIN?
++++++++++++++
RIN stands for Rangespan Identification Number; this is Rangespan's unique product identifier, and is matched on the barcode of the product and/or a Manufacturer and Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) combination.

2. DATA
=======

What are the image requirements for your retailers?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The minimum image resolution requirements are as follows:

- **Argos** - 700 x 700 pixels
- **Asda** - 1000 x 1000 pixels 
- **Ebuyer/Maplin** - minimum 500 x 500 pixels 
- **Staples** - 750 x 750 pixels
- **Tesco** - minimum 500 x 500 but subject to change
Note that all retailers require non-marked images with the products on a white background.

I want to upload multiple images for a product. How can I do this?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is not currently possible and we are working on picking these up with retailers. In the meantime, can you send us the highest resolution image URL or file and this will be presented as your product image.

--- Data Requirements section?

I want to change the content/layout of my product(s) on a retailer website. What should I do?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you want to adjust the data that appears on retailer websites, make the necessary changes to your catalogue feed (i.e. item names, item descriptions, images) and upload it. Once done, email the catalogue feed to us with the highlighted changes. Note that, whilst we have more freedom over product data on Tesco, other retailers choose how to display data on their websites. Therefore, it may be difficult to apply your suggestions.

3. FEEDS
========

How do I update inventory for my products?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You can update inventory levels by updating the "Inventory" column for all products in your feed, saving this as a `csv file <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/saving_csv.pdf>`_, and uploading this by following the guide `here <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/uploading-feed-webUI.pdf>`_.

I want to discontinue products with Rangespan. How should I do this?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Delete the entire line in the inventory feed and upload the file.

I want to upload a feed but I have forgotten my feed type.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you have migrated to the new feed types, your feed type for catalogue data is "Catalogue Feed"; for inventory data, the feed type is "Inventory Feed". If you have not migrated to the new feeds, please email us and we'll confirm your feed type. Please note this for future usage.

I'm getting error messages when I try to upload a feed. How can I get these resolved?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
See the `feed troubleshooting guide <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/feed-troubleshooting.pdf>`_. This is also available at the `upload portal <https://www.rangespan.com/upload/>`_.

I've just uploaded my feed and I want to check if the data has been uploaded correctly. How can I confirm this?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If there are no errors with your feed upload, then your data has been uploaded successfully. You can check on the "Offers" tab on our website.

What are the "Catalogue" and "Inventory" feeds? I'm not sure how to use the Rangespan feeds.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please see the `feed usage guide <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/feed-usage.pdf>`_ for information on our feeds and their usage.

I'm an existing supplier that wants to migrate to the new catalogue and stripped-down inventory feeds. Is there some documentation to help me with this process?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please see the `feed migration guide <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/feed-migration.pdf>`_.

Why do you have two feeds? Why can't I use one feed for both catalogue and inventory data?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Since catalogue data does not need to be uploaded as regularly as inventory data, we allow suppliers to upload data with two feeds with the inventory upload being more regular. Additionally, uploading catalogue data daily risks corrupted data (such as barcodes) causing problems with your listings that may result in lost sales.

I'm unsure on what data to include under certain columns in the feed. 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please see the `data definitions guide <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/data-definitions.pdf>`_.

I want to change the SKUs on my feed. Is this possible?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is possible but before making the changes in your feed, the SKUs need to be remapped on our system. Thus, send us an email with the old and new SKUs, and wait for confirmation before applying the change in your feeds.

Should I ring-fence inventory just for Rangespan? What happens if I go out of stock?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
No, you should supply Rangespan with your complete inventory holding. One of the services we provide to retailers is to manage the posting and partition of inventory to retailers. If items go out-of stock (e.g. due to sales through another of your channels) we can mitigate this via our broad supplier network. When items do go out of stock you should update your inventory feed and submit it to us as soon as possible (and at least daily).

What shipping methods do we need to provide?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The shipping methods to be offered by suppliers differ depending on the value of the item:

..  csv-table::

    "Items Less than £40:","Standard Post"
    "Items from £40 to £100:","Tracked Delivery"
    "Items greater than £100:","Tracked Signed Delivery"

4. RETAILER
===========
I have some new products that I want to make visible to retailers. How do I add these to Rangespan Search, and how can I increase the possibility of these being selected?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please see the `adding new products guide <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/adding-new-products.pdf>`_ on how to add products to Rangespan  Search. To increase the possibility of these being selected, ensure your products have "good" data (as detailed in the above link) and are competitively priced. Trending products with favourable reviews have a very high chance of being selected by retailers.

How does the retailer selection process work? How long will it take before my products are shown with a retailer?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note that your products must have good data before we can consider them for launch. 
For Tesco, we can list all products but we bear a cost for each product launched. Thus, certain products will be prioritised (based on cost, availability of data and/or category). Once products are ingested into the launching pipeline, they should be live within a few weeks.
For all other retailers, products are either proactively selected by the retailer, or our team can pitch your products based on trending categories and competitive prices. You should also play a vital part in raising buyers awareness of your products on Rangespan. Once approved by a retailer, your products should go live within a few weeks.

My products are showing as out of stock with a retailer. Please advise.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If your products are showing as out of stock, either:
- your products have zero inventory in your feed which is reflected on the retailer website. If the feed is showing positive inventory, and being uploaded successfully, there may be a system error, in which case you should contact us.
- the cost prices (including shipping) have increased in your feed leading to a system generated out of stock status. Please revert to the original cost prices which is given in our weekly Retailer Listings report. You should be receiving this automatically every week, so please email us if you aren't. Certain retailers make products unavailable if the prices are uncompetitive with Amazon. This is shown on the weekly Retailer Listings report that is emailed to you. If this is the case, please amend your prices to the target price shown on the report.

Why have my products been delisted with a retailer?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Products are delisted with retailers if either:
- they have been out of stock for a while (as above). This is to prevent over-cluttering of unavailable products on retailer websites.
- a retailer chooses to terminate certain listings. There is not much we can do to control this.

I want to change prices with a retailer for some of my products. What should I do?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Forward us the old and suggested price, with good reason for the increased price, but do not make the change active in your regular inventory upload. Our retailer team will suggest the increase to the retailer who will make a decision.

Could we have a sales forecast for products sold through a retailer?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We do not currently offer such a service to suppliers, but this is something we are hoping to offer. Please keep an eye on our monthly newsletter for further updates.

What is the typical margin for a certain category with a retailer?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The margin expectation differs from retailer to retailer and from category to category.  Amazon marketplace charges are good benchmarks while our large enterprise retailer partners usually expect higher.

5. ORDER
=========

How do I process an order?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please see the guide `here <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/order-management-webUI.pdf>`_. This is available at the `order portal <https://www.rangespan.com/orders/supplier/>`_ by clicking on the Help button.

Can I process orders in bulk?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Yes, please see the bulk order processing guide `here <https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/Bulk_Order_Processing_via_UI_Documentation.pdf>`_.

What is the difference between a Rangespan Order ID and a Rangespan Assignment Reference?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
When an order is placed with a retailer, it is given an Order ID (for example, 442543). The most appropriate supplier with available inventory will be assigned that order with a Rangespan Assignment Reference (i.e. 442543/463368).

Who should I contact for order-related queries?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please contact operations@rangespan.com, with the Order ID at hand.

Do you have any registered shipping providers?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You can use any shipping provider from the list below:
Business Post, City Link, Deutsche Post, DHL, DPD, Fastway, FedEx, GLS, Hermes, Interlink, Norbert Dentressangle, Parcelforce, Royal Mail, Target, TNT Post, Tuffnels, UK Mail, UPS, XDP and Yodel.

Are we required to use individual packing slips for each order, even when multiple items are shipped to the same customer?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Yes, since each packing slip contains returns information for that particular item you are required to include one packing slip for each item ordered. However, these items can be shipped together as one shipment if the delivery address is the same.

Can we insert marketing or promotional materials in the package?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
No, we do not allow the insertion of any additional marketing material into the box. The only item that should be added is the Rangespan packing slip.

Can we use our own branded packaging to dispatch products to the customer?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
No, our retailers require that all items be dispatched in plain, unbranded packaging that contains no references to other retailers or sales channels. 

Can we use our own packing slips? Can we use our own logo on the packing slip?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Rather than using Rangespan's packing slip you can use our API integration options to download the key Rangespan packing slip information (retailer logo, returns barcodes) into your own dispatch system. However, we require that the packing slips contain only the retailer's branding.

6. RETURNS
==========

What are the costs associated with customer returns?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please see here: https://www.rangespan.com/downloads/return-cost.pdf

What is the returns policy?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We require suppliers to accept mint and sellable returns up to 45 days after dispatch. As is standard industry practice we require suppliers to accept faulty returns up to 12 months after dispatch. All returns from customers are made to our third party distribution partner who grade and forward on returns to suppliers as appropriate.

Why do you require 45 days for returns?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
All our retailers offer 30 day return promises. The 45 day return period that Rangespan requires allows 15 days to get the product returned to the supplier once we have received if from the retailer. The vast majority of returns occur much sooner than this time period.

7. INVOICING
============

Do we need to send Rangespan invoices?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Rangespan self-invoice's on a monthly basis. Therefore there is no need for you to send invoices. We welcome monthly statements to be sent. This ensures disputes are resolved in a timely fashion.

When do we receive our invoices?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Invoices are sent to you at the beginning of each month for all transactions shipped, lost in mail, refunded or manually adjusted in the previous month. The monthly invoice  correspondence consists of a summary and detail file which contains all the necessary references for a complete reconciliation.

When will we receive payment?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The benefit of self-billing allows Rangespan to pay in a timely fashion. Payment will be made 7 days or earlier after each month end.

I've just received my invoice, and there seems to be a miscalculation. Who should I talk to?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note that your invoice is generated from the cost prices in your inventory feed. Kindly double-check these before emailing supplier-accounts@rangespan.com for invoice-related queries.
